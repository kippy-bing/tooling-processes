# Standard Operating Procedure: Heat Treatment for P-45B Forming Punches

## Part Information
- **Part ID:** P-45B
- **Material:** 1095 High-Carbon Steel
- **Application:** Custom forming punches for sheet metal stamping

## Objective
To achieve a hardened, wear-resistant surface while maintaining adequate toughness to prevent cracking during service.

## Current Procedure

### 1. Austenitizing
- Heat parts uniformly to **845°C (1555°F)** in a controlled atmosphere furnace.
- Soak at temperature for **30 minutes per inch of cross-section** (minimum 15 minutes for P-45B).
- Ensure complete austenite transformation.

### 2. Quenching
- Rapidly quench parts in **fast-quench oil** (type: Houghton K‑Oil) at 60°C (140°F).
- Agitate parts vigorously to minimize vapor blanket and ensure uniform cooling.
- Quench until parts reach ambient temperature (approx. 30–40°C).

### 3. Tempering
- Temper immediately after quenching (within 2 hours).
- Heat to **180°C (355°F)** in a circulating-air tempering furnace.
- Soak for **2 hours** at temperature.
- Air cool to room temperature.

### 4. Inspection
- Hardness check: target **60–62 HRC**.
- Visual inspection for cracks (magnified 10×).
- Dimensional verification.

## Notes
- This procedure has been in use since Q2 2023.
- All temperatures are ±10°C.
- Record all parameters in the heat‑treatment log.
